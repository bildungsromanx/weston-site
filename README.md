How to update content on GitHub:

All editable content is stored in the data folder. You can safely edit these files without touching the main code.

    1. Go to the GitHub repo and navigate to the file you want to edit:

        Example: data/projects.js contains your project information.
    
    2. Click the pencil icon in the top-right corner to edit the file in the browser.

        Make changes only inside the quotes (" "). Do not remove brackets {} or commas ,.

        Example:

            export const projects = [
            {
                title: "Website Redesign", // <-- edit this text
                description: "A complete website overhaul for a local business.", // <-- edit this text
                image: "/images/project1.jpg", // <-- edit image path
                link: "https://clientwebsite.com/project1" // <-- edit link
            }
            ];


    3. Scroll down to the Commit changes section:

        Add a short description (e.g., “Updated project description”)

    4. Choose Commit directly to the main branch

    5. Click Commit changes

        Changes will automatically update the live site on Vercel within a few minutes.
